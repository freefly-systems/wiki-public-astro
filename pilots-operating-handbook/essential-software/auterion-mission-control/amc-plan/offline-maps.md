# Offline Maps

**Using Offline Maps on the Ground Control Station (GCS)** allows operators to access detailed maps and navigate effectively without requiring an active internet connection. This feature is particularly useful in remote areas where a stable internet connection may not be available. By pre-downloading map data, operators can continue to plan and monitor missions, ensuring continuous situational awareness and flight control. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using offline maps on the GCS, helping you maintain reliable navigation capabilities in areas with limited connectivity.



## Downloading Offline Maps

Offline maps can be downloaded through the 'Offline Maps' section in the AMC settings. The vehicle will not need to be turned on to download maps, but the tablet will need to be connected to the internet. After maps are downloaded, they will be available without a network connection on the tablet. If terrain data is needed, make sure the elevation provider is selected when downloading maps.&#x20;

When downloading offline maps, you have the options to change the map provider as well as changing the zoom levels. The smaller you allow the zoom, the higher amount of dta it will use. You can see the estimated size the download will be under the zoom levels. If terrain data is needed, make sure the elevation provider is chosen during download.&#x20;
