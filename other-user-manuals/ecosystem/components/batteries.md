Astro uses Freefly SuperLight Batteries, the SL-8 Air version. This is a brief summary of their essential functions. For complete documentation and specifications, see the [SuperLight Battery Wiki](https://docs.freeflysystems.com/ecosystem/power/superlight-batteries).

### **Charging**

Connect the charger to a power outlet and the battery. The onboard battery management system will do the rest. A lightning bolt symbol indicates the battery is charging. The screen will show a charging time estimate.

### **Installation**

Slide the batteries into the rails on top of Astro until the latches click. Check that the latches are fully down. It is also recommended to pull the battery in the opposite direction to ensure that the battery cannot be removed without releasing the latch.&#x20;

Press the button twice to activate. Activating one battery automatically activates the other battery.&#x20;

### Flying Back-to-Back

Four sets of SuperLight batteries and 6 SL Fast Chargers are needed to fly Astro back-to-back continuously. Assumes every pack is drained to 6% and pack temperatures are low enough to permit immediate charging. In hot weather, the batteries must cool before flying add one set of batteries.
