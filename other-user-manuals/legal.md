## Disclaimer and Warning&#x20;

Please read this disclaimer and warning carefully and review the Astro Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) prior to flight. If you have any questions, please contact [support@freeflysystems.com](mailto:%20support@freeflysystems.com) prior to using the Astro. You can review the most current version of this manual on the [Astro Support Page](https://freeflysystems.com/support/astro-support).&#x20;

By using Astro, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to this disclaimer. You agree that you are solely responsible for your conduct while using Astro, and for any direct or indirect consequences that may result from its use. You agree to only use Astro for proper purposes that are in accordance with local and airspace rules and regulations.&#x20;

* Astro is not a toy and should be operated with extreme care, as improper operation can cause damage to property, serious personal injury or death.&#x20;
* As with any multi-rotor aircraft, Astro is a complex and technical machine. Novice pilots should invest sufficient time on a flight simulator and seek training from an experienced pilot prior to operation. The Astro Aircraft Flight Manual and a flight simulator are no substitute for training with an experienced pilot, particularly when it comes to learning how to safely operate Astro. Novice pilots should never fly without the supervision of an experienced pilot.&#x20;
* Always check Astro and its components prior to operation. Always maintain a safe distance from Astro when in use.&#x20;
* Never attempt to touch Astro when the propellers are moving.
* Never fly Astro over or around people, power lines or other aircraft.
* Never fly with any propellers that have visible imperfections or damage.&#x20;
* Always keep children and animals a safe distance away from Astro when in use and when changing configurations.&#x20;
* Only use propellers supplied by Freefly Systems that are designed for use on Astro.&#x20;
* Always remove the propellers or power Astro using a low power source when making a change to the configuration of Astro to prevent propeller strikes in the event of unintentional motor starts. Always remove the configuration jumper when making changes to the configuration of Astro.&#x20;
* Always test Astro with the propellers removed to make sure that the motors are spinning in the correct direction and that the motor assignment is correct with respect to the Autopilot flight controller. If you have either of these wrong, the Astro will be uncontrollable and dangerous.&#x20;
* It is your responsibility to perform a full system check of Astro prior to every flight.&#x20;
* It is your responsibility to learn how to safely operate Astro and to adhere to all applicable rules and regulations.&#x20;
* Fly at your own risk.&#x20;
* Astro is a tuned system with custom components selected for each application. Modification, removal, or substitution of Astro components will void the warranty and can lead to unsafe operating conditions.&#x20;
