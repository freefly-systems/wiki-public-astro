# Flux LiDAR Payload

Flux is a LiDAR payload designed for seamless integration with Astro. Setup and data capture with Flux is quick and simple, and lidar scans can be processed super fast in the field to ensure you captured the data you need.

There are three variants of Flux, featuring proven lidar sensors from Livox, Hesai, and Ouster. Flux provides survey-grade accuracy for 3D mapping applications across various fields, such as surveying, construction, infrastructure management, forestry, mining, aggregates, and more.

Flux boasts a high-performance on-site LiDAR workflow that significantly improves mapping efficiency. With advanced low-noise IMUs, dual full-band GNSS receivers (L1/L2/L5/L6), and a built-in 20MP camera for colorization \[coming soon], it truly enhances the overall mapping experience.
