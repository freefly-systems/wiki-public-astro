## Video Workflow&#x20;

The LR1 Payload was primary designed for photography applications (mapping, inspection, scenic photography), but can shoot video as well.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Smoother gimbal control and additional parameters were added in Astro FW 2.0! Check it out here:&#x20;

## Video Settings

The camera is capable of shooting up to 4K, 60 fps footage in 8 bit or 10 bit, with normal and Slog profiles

{% hint style="info" %}
A V90 Class SD card is needed for some recording modes. The LR1 Payload ships with a V60 Class SD card which is fast enough for 4K30 fps 8 bit footage. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

The External USB drive isn't fast enough to record high quality video, so videos will save the camera's SD card.&#x20;

You can switch between taking images and video footage using this button in Photo Mode:&#x20;

## #Protips

{% hint style="danger" %}
The Sony ILX-LR1 can get very hot when recording video, especially high frame rate and high bitrate footage. If the camera gets too hot, it will shutdown!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend flying in 'Slow mode' for smooth/precise yawing motions with the gimbal. Setting the vertical/horizontal speeds to max is speeds as Position mode, but allows precise control over the yaw rate of the aircraft. This is particularly useful for longer lenses
{% endhint %}

* We have been getting good video results with the Sigma 24mm, Sony 35mm lenses, and Sony 50mm. The Samyang 75mm can sometimes have issues with stability during acceleration and deceleration.&#x20;
* If you are seeing any vibrations in the footage, check:
  * You are using the right vibration isolator&#x20;
  * The gimbal is balanced properly&#x20;
