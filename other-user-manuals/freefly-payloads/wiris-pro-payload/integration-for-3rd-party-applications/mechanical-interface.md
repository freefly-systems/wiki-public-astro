## Mounting

The Wiris Pro Payload uses the Smart Dovetail/Pixhawk Payload Bus Quick Release mechanical mount. An overview of the Smart Dovetail, including a 3D CAD model of the Smart Dovetail male and female sides is available here:

You are encouraged to use this model to integrate the Smart Dovetail design into your own UAV! Conversely, you can purchase a Smart Dovetail mount with a 32 x 32mm M3 mounting bolt pattern from Freefly for easy installation:
