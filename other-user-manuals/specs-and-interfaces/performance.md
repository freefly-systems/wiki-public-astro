## Thrust To Weight Ratio

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-15 at 6.40.38 PM.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* T/W ratio between 1.47 and 1.6 should be flown with caution. Imbalanced payload/aircraft in combination with wind may cause crashes. Astro prioritizes its attitude and will lose altitude in these scenarios.

## Flight Time

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Astro Max (7010) versus Astro (F45) Hover Time (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Conducted at Sea Level and 8C temperature</p></figcaption></figure>

Our flight tests for the Astro (F45) and Astro Max (7010) were conducted by running the batteries from 100% down to 0%. While this is not typical in real-world operations—where a pilot would usually land with some remaining battery for safety—it provides a clear baseline for comparing performance between airframes and payloads. Interestingly, as shown in the “Flight Time versus Flight Speed” chart, hovering draws more power than flying forward at a moderate speed. Because most real flights involve some forward motion (rather than continuous hovering), these 100%–0% hover results end up being a fair representation of typical flights that land with higher battery reserves.&#x20;

## Noise

The volume of the aircraft at ground level depends on several factors, including payload weight, wind speed and direction, and the background noise of the environment. The following data was gathered with an Astro in hover carrying the A7R4 camera and gimbal, tested from 5 meters to 100 meters away from the user, from 5 meters altitude to 120 meters altitude.

This data is presented in the ‘A-Weighted’ scale, which approximates the average loudness sensed by the human ear, and is used by the FAA to measure aircraft noise.

In our testing, hovering and forward flight showed similar values of the ground noise produced by the aircraft.
